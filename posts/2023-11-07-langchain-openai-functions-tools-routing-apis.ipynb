    "This article will delve into the mechanics of OpenAI's functions, how to use it to select the appropriate tools for an LLM, and how to execute them efficiently. This can give you the knowledge to create your own tools tailored to specific tasks and to utilize them effectively within the OpenAI framework and Langchain to create powerful LLM based applications.\n",

    "## Understanding Langchain & OpenAI Tools & Functions \n",
    "\n",
    "When we consider having an OpenAI function, there are two parts to it. The first is to let a language model pick which function to employ and what its input should be. The next step is to use those inputs to call that function. Langchain combines those two ideas into a tool, which is really a schema definition for the function that we can then convert into the OpenAI functions type, and a callable, which allows us to actually call that model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of these tools are incorporated into the package search tools, mask tools, and SQL tools in Langchain, but we'll focus on constructing our own tools in this piece. One thing that has been discovered is that when constructing your own chain and agents, a lot of it is dependent on really creating your own tools because what you're attempting to do is probably pretty specific to your own work. So we'll go over how to simply design our own tools, and then we'll go over how to use a layer form to select which tools to use, and then call those tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin with the standard setup, followed by the import of the tool decorator in Langchain. So we can use this decorator on top of the function, and then when we define the function, we'll go over how to use the code. So we may use this tool decorator on top of the function that we define. This automatically transforms the function into a Langchain tool that we can use and analyse. So this search engine now has a name, a description, and arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, all of these will be used to create the open definition action. We may further improve on this by creating a more explicit input schema structure. This is particularly significant since, once again, the language model uses the description of the input to determine what the input should be. As a result, having a very explicit specification for the input becomes critical. "

       "'Page: LangChain\\nSummary: LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs). As a language model integration framework, LangChain\\'s use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis.\\n\\nPage: Prompt engineering\\nSummary: Prompt engineering is the process of structuring text that can be interpreted and understood by a generative AI model. A prompt is natural language text describing the task that an AI should perform.A prompt for a text-to-text model can be a query such as \"what is Fermat\\'s little theorem?\", a command such as \"write a poem about leaves falling\", a short statement of feedback (for example, \"too verbose\", \"too formal\", \"rephrase again\", \"omit this word\") or a longer statement including context, instructions, and input data. Prompt engineering may involve phrasing a query, specifying a style, providing relevant context or assigning a role to the AI such as \"Act as a native French speaker\". A prompt may include a few examples for a model to learn from, such as \"maison -> house, chat -> cat, chien -> dog\", an approach called few-shot learning.When communicating with a text-to-image or a text-to-audio model, a typical prompt is a description of a desired output such as \"a high-quality photo of an astronaut riding a horse\" or \"Lo-fi slow BPM electro chill with organic samples\". Prompting a text-to-image model may involve adding, removing, emphasizing and re-ordering words to achieve a desired subject, style, layout, lighting, and aesthetic.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Sentence embedding\\nSummary: In natural language processing, a sentence embedding refers to a numeric representation of a sentence in the form of a vector of real numbers which encodes meaningful semantic information.State of the art embeddings are based on the learned hidden layer representation of dedicated sentence transformer models. BERT pioneered an approach involving the use of a dedicated [CLS] token prepended to the beginning of each sentence inputted into the model; the final hidden state vector of this token encodes information about the sentence and can be fine-tuned for use in sentence classification tasks. In practice however, BERT\\'s sentence embedding with the [CLS] token achieves poor performance, often worse than simply averaging non-contextual word embeddings. SBERT later achieved superior sentence embedding performance by fine tuning BERT\\'s [CLS] token embeddings through the usage of a siamese neural network architecture on the SNLI dataset. \\nOther approaches are loosely based on the idea of distributional semantics applied to sentences. Skip-Thought trains an encoder-decoder structure for the task of neighboring sentences predictions. Though this has been shown to achieve worse performance than approaches such as InferSent or SBERT. \\nAn alternative direction is to aggregate word embeddings, such as those returned by Word2vec, into sentence embeddings. The most straightforward approach is to simply compute the average of word vectors, known as continuous bag-of-words (CBOW). However, more elaborate solutions based on word vector quantization have also been proposed. One such approach is the vector of locally aggregated word embeddings (VLAWE), which demonstrated performance improvements in downstream text classification tasks.\\n\\n'"

    "\n",
    "So far, we've generated functions in our article and then open AI function definitions for those functions. Functions with which we want to engage are frequently exposed behind the API. In addition, APIs frequently have a defined specification for its inputs and outputs known as an open API specification. So what we're going to demonstrate now is how to take one of these open API steps and convert it into a list of open AI function calls. Again, this is quite handy because much functionality is hidden behind API.\n",

       "'Page: LangChain\\nSummary: LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the creation of applications using large language models (LLMs). As a language model integration framework, LangChain\\'s use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in general, including document analysis and summarization, chatbots, and code analysis.\\n\\nPage: Prompt engineering\\nSummary: Prompt engineering is the process of structuring text that can be interpreted and understood by a generative AI model. A prompt is natural language text describing the task that an AI should perform.A prompt for a text-to-text model can be a query such as \"what is Fermat\\'s little theorem?\", a command such as \"write a poem about leaves falling\", a short statement of feedback (for example, \"too verbose\", \"too formal\", \"rephrase again\", \"omit this word\") or a longer statement including context, instructions, and input data. Prompt engineering may involve phrasing a query, specifying a style, providing relevant context or assigning a role to the AI such as \"Act as a native French speaker\". A prompt may include a few examples for a model to learn from, such as \"maison -> house, chat -> cat, chien -> dog\", an approach called few-shot learning.When communicating with a text-to-image or a text-to-audio model, a typical prompt is a description of a desired output such as \"a high-quality photo of an astronaut riding a horse\" or \"Lo-fi slow BPM electro chill with organic samples\". Prompting a text-to-image model may involve adding, removing, emphasizing and re-ordering words to achieve a desired subject, style, layout, lighting, and aesthetic.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Sentence embedding\\nSummary: In natural language processing, a sentence embedding refers to a numeric representation of a sentence in the form of a vector of real numbers which encodes meaningful semantic information.State of the art embeddings are based on the learned hidden layer representation of dedicated sentence transformer models. BERT pioneered an approach involving the use of a dedicated [CLS] token prepended to the beginning of each sentence inputted into the model; the final hidden state vector of this token encodes information about the sentence and can be fine-tuned for use in sentence classification tasks. In practice however, BERT\\'s sentence embedding with the [CLS] token achieves poor performance, often worse than simply averaging non-contextual word embeddings. SBERT later achieved superior sentence embedding performance by fine tuning BERT\\'s [CLS] token embeddings through the usage of a siamese neural network architecture on the SNLI dataset. \\nOther approaches are loosely based on the idea of distributional semantics applied to sentences. Skip-Thought trains an encoder-decoder structure for the task of neighboring sentences predictions. Though this has been shown to achieve worse performance than approaches such as InferSent or SBERT. \\nAn alternative direction is to aggregate word embeddings, such as those returned by Word2vec, into sentence embeddings. The most straightforward approach is to simply compute the average of word vectors, known as continuous bag-of-words (CBOW). However, more elaborate solutions based on word vector quantization have also been proposed. One such approach is the vector of locally aggregated word embeddings (VLAWE), which demonstrated performance improvements in downstream text classification tasks.\\n\\n'"

    "In this post, we've outlined the intricacies of OpenAI's advanced tool usage, from the langchain concept to the practical creation of tools and their integration with APIs. We've also shown how the OpenAI model can act as a smart selector and executor of functions, culminating in a comprehensive system capable of routing and performing actions. \n",
