When trying to persist huge volumes of data or persist it in a cloud storage location, there are different vector stores that provide hosted solutions. \n",

As a result, we are receiving findings that are presumably quite relevant to regression, and if we look at the fifth document, which is the one from the first lecture, we can see that regression is in fact mentioned there. \n",
