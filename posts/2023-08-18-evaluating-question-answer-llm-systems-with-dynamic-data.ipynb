For example, if you're designing a Q&A system on top of a database or that connects to an API, the underlying data may be updated regularly. Instead of storing labels directly as values, we'll utilise references to overcome this issue in this post using Langsmith where our labels will be references to look up the relevant values.\n",

For example, if you're designing a Q&A system on top of a database or that connects to an API, the underlying data may be updated regularly. In such instances, you should still measure the correctness of your system, but you should do so in a method that compensates for these changes.\n",

    "In the following post, we will handle this issue using Langsmith and the age-old software practise of indirection. Rather than storing labels as values, we will use them as _references_ to look for the correct values. In this example, our labels will be queries that the custom evaluator can use to retrieve the ground truth answer and compare it to the model's predictions.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we examined a Q&A system that was linked to a developing data repository. We accomplished so by employing a custom evaluator that dynamically retrieves the answer based on a static reference (in this case, a code snippet).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is only one solution to the challenge of evaluating Q&A systems when the underlying data source changes. This approach is straightforward and immediately tests the accuracy of your system end-to-end using current data. It can be useful if you wish to monitor your performance on a regular basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is less reliable if your purpose is to compare two different prompts or models because the underlying data may differ. Depending on how you dereference the labels, prudence and correct permissioning are also required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other options to evaluate your system in this scenario include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Freezing or mocking the data source(s) used for evaluation. You can then invest in hand-labeling periodically to make sure the data is still reprentative of the production environment.\n",
    "- Testing the query generation capability of your agent directly and evaluate the equivalence of the queries. This is less \"end-to-end\", but it depending on how you compare, you'd avoid any potential issues caused by unsafe dereferencing.\n",
