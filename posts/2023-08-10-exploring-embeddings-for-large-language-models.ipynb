    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The most fascinating and useful components of machine learning are vector embeddings, which are essential to many natural language processing, recommendation, and search algorithms. You have dealt with embedding-using systems if you have used voice assistants, recommendation engines, or translators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings are semantically rich dense vector representations of data that are well suited for a variety of machine learning applications, including clustering, recommendation, and classification. They can be generated for a variety of data kinds, including text, photos, and audio, and they convert human-perceived semantic similarity into closeness in vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "For text data, vector embeddings of words, phrases, or paragraphs are produced using models from the GPT family of models and Llama. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), like VGG and Inception, may produce embeddings for images. Using image embedding methods on spectrograms and other visual representations of audio frequencies, audio recordings can be turned into vectors. It is common practise to use deep neural networks to train models that transform objects into vectors. The resulting embeddings are frequently dense and high-dimensional.\n",
    "\n",
    "In similarity search applications like KNN and ANN, where computing the distances between vectors to identify similarity is necessary, embeddings are widely utilised. For tasks like de-duplication, recommendations, anomaly detection, and reverse image search, nearest neighbour search can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Similarity search and vector embeddings \n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-3, a potent language model provided by OpenAI, can be used for a variety of tasks, including creating embeddings and running similarity searches. In this example, we'll create embeddings for a collection of documents using the OpenAI API and then do a similarity search using cosine similarity."

    "Cohere's sophisticated language models are the perfect fit for LangChain, a complete library created for language comprehension and processing. This enables a wider range of applications, from semantic search to customer feedback analysis and content moderation, across a number of languages. It makes it easier to integrate Cohere's multilingual embeddings into a developer's workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "When combined with Cohere, LangChain removes the need for intricate pipelines, making the generation and manipulation of high-dimensional embeddings simple and effective. When linked to Cohere's embedding endpoint and given a list of multilingual texts, the embed_documents() method in LangChain's CohereEmbeddings class may quickly create distinct semantic embeddings for each text.\n",

    "## Deep Lake Vector Store\n",
    "\n",
    "High-dimensional vectors can be efficiently stored and managed using **vector stores**, which are data structures or databases. They make it possible to do nearest neighbour searches, similarity searches, and other vector-related operations quickly. Different data structures, such as KD trees, Vantage Point trees, or approximate nearest neighbour (ANN) methods, can be used to build vector stores.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep Lake** functions as a multi-modal vector store as well as a data lake for deep learning. As a multi-modal vector store, it allows users to store images, audio, videos, text, and metadata in a format optimized for deep learning. Users are able to search both embeddings and their properties thanks to hybrid search enabled by it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Users can save data locally, on Activeloop storage, or on their personal cloud. With little boilerplate code, Deep Lake allows training TensorFlow and PyTorch models while streaming data. Additionally, it offers capabilities like distributed workloads, dataset queries, and version control utilising a straightforward Python API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it gets harder and harder to store datasets in local memory as they grow in size. Since there aren't many documents being uploaded, a nearby vector store could have been used in this case. However, in a normal production environment, where thousands or millions of documents may be involved and accessible by numerous programmes, the need for a centralised cloud dataset becomes apparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use Deep Lake as an example to understand how this works.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Deep Lake Vector Store embeddings example\n",
    "\n",
    "We can follow the example for creating a vector store in addition to other examples for which Deep Lake has supplied Jupyter Notebooks to its well-written instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create and manage high-dimensional embeddings, this effort attempts to make use of the capabilities of NLP technologies, specifically OpenAI and Deep Lake. These embeddings can be used for a number of tasks, including looking up pertinent papers, editing content, and responding to inquiries. In this instance, a retrieval-based question-answering system will be built using a Deep Lake database.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we must import the necessary packages and make sure that the environment variables ACTIVELOOP_TOKEN and OPENAI_API_KEY have the Activeloop and OpenAI keys. Obtaining an ACTIVELOOP_TOKEN is simple; just generate one on the Activeloop page. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the necessary modules from the langchain package are imported."

    "This pipeline demonstrates how to leverage the power of the LangChain, OpenAI, and Deep Lake libraries and products to create a conversational AI model capable of retrieving and answering questions based on the content of a given repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down each step to understand how these technologies work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **OpenAI and LangChain Integration**: LangChain, a library built for chaining NLP models, is designed to work seamlessly with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model for language understanding and generation. You've initialized OpenAI embeddings using OpenAIEmbeddings(), and these embeddings are later used to transform the text into a high-dimensional vector representation. This vector representation captures the semantic essence of the text and is essential for information retrieval tasks.\n",
    "2. **Deep Lake**: Deep Lake is a Vector Store for creating, storing, and querying vector representations (also known as embeddings) of data.\n",
    "3. **Text Retrieval**: Using the db.as_retriever() function, you've transformed the Deep Lake dataset into a retriever object. This object is designed to fetch the most relevant pieces of text from the dataset based on the semantic similarity of their embeddings.\n",
    "4. **Question Answering**: The final step involves setting up a RetrievalQA chain from LangChain. This chain is designed to accept a natural language question, transform it into an embedding, retrieve the most relevant document chunks from the Deep Lake dataset, and generate a natural language answer. The ChatOpenAI model, which is the underlying model of this chain, is responsible for both the question embedding and the answer generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The rich contextual information in our textual data can be captured and understood in large part thanks to vector embeddings. When dealing with low token capacity language models like GPT-3.5-turbo, this representation assumes increasing importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to using embeddings from Hugging Face and Cohere, we used embeddings from OpenAI in this post. Transformer-based models are offered by the former, a renowned AI research organisation, and are very flexible and popular. In an increasingly linked world, Cohere's revolutionary multilingual language models are a great benefit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've walked through the process of developing a conversational AI application, specifically a Q&A system utilising Deep Lake, based on these technologies. This application shows the potential of these merged technologies: Hugging Face, Cohere, OpenAI, and Hugging Face for producing high-quality embeddings; Deep Lake for keeping these embeddings in a vector store; and LangChain for chaining together complex NLP operations.\n",
