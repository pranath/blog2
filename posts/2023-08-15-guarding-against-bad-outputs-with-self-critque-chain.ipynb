    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models (LLMs) can produce unpleasant results on occasion. Some well-known examples of this behaviour include hazardous or hallucinatory content. It is critical to use a technique to ensure that the model's answers are appropriate in a production setting. Fortunately, these foundational models have the necessary knowledge to correct themselves with a gentle push in the proper direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The self-critique chain will keep the model on track by iterating through its output and determining whether or not the pre-defined expectations have been satisfied. If not, it instructs the model to correct itself depending on the application's specifications. For example, it will ensure that a student mentoring assistant answers queries in a fair and ethical manner. \n",
