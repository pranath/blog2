    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models such as [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) can generate text responses based on a given prompt or input. Writing prompts allow users to guide the language model's output by providing a specific context or topic for the response. This feature has many practical applications, such as generating creative writing prompts, assisting in content creation, and even aiding in customer service chatbots. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a writing prompt such as \"Write a short story about a time traveler who goes back to the medieval period\" could lead the language model to generate a variety of unique and creative responses. Additionally, prompts can be used to generate more specific and relevant responses for tasks such as language translation or summarization. In these cases, the prompt would provide information about the desired output, such as the language to be translated or the key points to be included in the summary. Overall, prompts provide a way to harness the power of large language models for a wide range of practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, creating effective prompts for large language models remains a significant challenge, as even prompts that seem similar can produce vastly different outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my previous article, we looked at [two prompting principles and their related tactics in order to write effective prompts for large language models](2023-05-01-best-practice-for-prompting-large-language-models.html) to get better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we will iteratively analyze and refine prompts to generate marketing copy from a product fact sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prompt Development\n",
    "\n",
    "The process for writing prompts can be similar in that you start with an idea for what you want to accomplish, make a first attempt at writing a prompt that is hopefully clear and specific, and perhaps, if appropriate, gives the system time to think, before running it and observing the outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "And if it doesn't work well enough the first time, you can always go back and make adjustments to the idea and prompt until you find one that works for your application by iteratively determining why the instructions, for instance, weren't clear enough or the algorithm wasn't given enough time to think.

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/pranath/blog/raw/master/images/iterative-prompt.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there probably isn't a perfect prompt for every situation, it may not be worth paying as much attention to internet publications that list 'great prompts'. It's more crucial that you have a method for creating a strong prompt for your particular application. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will be able to develop a prompt that is effective for the activity you want to accomplish as long as you have a good procedure for iteratively improving your prompt. "

    "In reality, it would take several repetitions before you arrived at a prompt like this. The first time someone tried to get the system to process a fact sheet, I don't think I know anyone who would use this identical prompt. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of prompt development is iterative. To get closer to getting the outcomes you want, try something, evaluate how it falls short of exactly what you want, and then consider how to make your instructions clearer or, in some circumstances, consider how to give it more time to deliberate. And I believe that having a robust methodology in place to create prompts that work well for your application rather than knowing the ideal prompt is the key to being an excellent prompt engineer. \n",

    "You might occasionally have a large sample size for more complicated applications, such a list of 10, 50, or 100 fact sheets. The prompt can then be developed iteratively and evaluated against a variety of scenarios. \n",
    "However, many people are constructing it somewhat similarly to this with just one example in the initial stages of the majority of apps. To compare prompts to a larger collection of samples, however, may occasionally be helpful for more sophisticated applications. Consider testing various prompts on a large number of fact sheets to determine their average or worst-case performance.\n",
