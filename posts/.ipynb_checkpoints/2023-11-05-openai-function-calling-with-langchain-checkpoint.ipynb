    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In our ongoing exploration of artificial intelligence tools, this article synthesizes insights from our previous articles, focusing on the integration of OpenAI functions with Langchain's expression language. We will also delve into the utility of PyDantic, a Python library that simplifies the construction of OpenAI functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding PyDantic\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is PyDantic?**\n",
    "PyDantic is a robust data validation library in Python that enhances the functionality of Python's data classes. This library facilitates the definition of data structures with stringent type enforcement and validation, offering an efficient means to manage data integrity. Moreover, PyDantic is especially useful for converting data structures to JSON format, which is instrumental in constructing OpenAI function descriptions. It offers a concise way to define data structures while ensuring that the data adheres to specified types and constraints. it also makes it really easy to export those structures to JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "That will be useful because we can utilise the PyDantic object to generate OpenAI function descriptions. [Remember how those OpenAI function descriptions](/posts/2023-11-03-openai-function-calling-a-step-by-step-guide.html) were a large chunk of JSON with a variety of different coding? We can use PyDantic to avoid having to think about all of that. We'll accomplish this by creating a PyDantic class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implementing PyDantic Classes**\n",
    "The implementation of PyDantic involves defining classes with typed attributes instead of the traditional `__init__` method. These classes serve as templates for generating JSON schemas for OpenAI functions, bypassing the intricacies of manual JSON crafting.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's fairly similar to a standard Python class, so you can compare them here. The primary difference is that instead of an init function, we'll simply specify the attributes and their types in the class declaration. We're not going to do anything with these classes. We'll just use it to write the OpenAI function in JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Application of PyDantic\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setting Up the Environment**\n",
    "We begin by setting up our working environment, importing necessary PyDantic classes, and preparing the usual Python class for comparison."

    "A conventional Python class, equipped with an `__init__` method, allows for the instantiation of objects with attributes like name, age, and email. However, this approach lacks built-in validation. Conversely, a PyDantic class automatically validates input data, raising errors when invalid data is supplied, ensuring data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll begin with the most basic Python class. So we'll have the standard Python class producer, which has an init function to which we supply the name, age, and email. So, if we make an instance of this, we can see that we have a standard Python class and that we can access the elements based on them. So, if age is an incorrect value, we have bar, which is a string, and we accept the init term. We can see that it produces it properly. And if we look at the element, we can see that it is active. And that's not good because we need some validation of that."

Then there's a single argument named airport code, which we enter as a string. Then, to get the weather search, we add this field description for airport code."

    "## Conclusion: Advancing with OpenAI and Langchain\n",
    "\n",
    "We've ventured through the process of using PyDantic for structuring OpenAI functions and integrating these with Langchain's expression language. The power of PyDantic to enforce data integrity and facilitate JSON schema creation is evident, as is the flexibility of Langchain in handling dynamic function calls. \n",

    "## Acknowledgements\n",

    "I'd like to express my thanks to the wonderful [Functions, Tools and Agents with LangChain](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/functions-tools-agents-langchain/) by DeepLearning.ai - which i completed, and acknowledge the use of some images and other materials from the course in this article."
