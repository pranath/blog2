    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. But using LLMs in isolation is often not enough in practice to create a truly powerful or useful business application - the real power comes when you are able to combine them with other sources of computation, services or knowledge. [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html) is an intuitive open-source python framework created to simplify the development of useful applications using large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI or Hugging Face. \n",
    "\n",
    "In [earlier articles](/#category=langchain) we introduced the LangChain library and key components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we look at how LangChain can help evaluate LLM performance. This can be useful to understand how LLM's are performing in general, or when you change some element of the application such as using a different model, or using a different type of vector store - being able to measure how that change might impact performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use OpenAI's ChatGPT LLM for our examples, so lets load in the required libraries."

    "\n",
    "The actual strings of the Real vs Predicted here are very different, one is very short the other very long - Yes does not even appear in the other string. So if we were going to do some kind of string matching for evaluation or one based on similar words such as the NLP text similarity metric [BLEU score](https://towardsdatascience.com/evaluating-text-output-in-nlp-bleu-at-your-own-risk-e8609665a213) it would not work because the similarity is not based on superficial aspects of language such as words but deeper aspects of language such as meaning. And this is exactly the kind of understanding that language models can do, which are not based on any kind of specific rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what makes evaluation of language models so hard in the first place, but ironically enables us to use language models to solve it. This makes previous NLP evaluation metrics such as the BLEU score inadaquate for evaluatiing these more complex models, so we need to invent new ones such as this method - which is one of the most popular methods currently.\n",
