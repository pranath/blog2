    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models such as [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) can generate text responses based on a given prompt or input. Writing prompts allow users to guide the language model's output by providing a specific context or topic for the response. This feature has many practical applications, such as generating creative writing prompts, assisting in content creation, and even aiding in customer service chatbots. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a writing prompt such as \"Write a short story about a time traveler who goes back to the medieval period\" could lead the language model to generate a variety of unique and creative responses. Additionally, prompts can be used to generate more specific and relevant responses for tasks such as language translation or summarization. In these cases, the prompt would provide information about the desired output, such as the language to be translated or the key points to be included in the summary. Overall, prompts provide a way to harness the power of large language models for a wide range of practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, creating effective prompts for large language models remains a significant challenge, as even prompts that seem similar can produce vastly different outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my previous article, we looked at [how to develop prompts for large language models iteratively](2023-05-02-iterative-prompt-development-for-large-language-models.html).\n",
