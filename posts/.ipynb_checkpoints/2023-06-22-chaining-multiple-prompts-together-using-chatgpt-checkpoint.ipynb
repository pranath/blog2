    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models such as [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) can generate text responses based on a given prompt or input. Writing prompts allow users to guide the language model's output by providing a specific context or topic for the response. This feature has many practical applications, such as generating creative writing prompts, assisting in content creation, and even aiding in customer service chatbots. \n",
    "\n",
    "In [earlier articles](/#category=openai) i've looked at how you can use ChatGPT to solve some of these tasks with simple prompts. But in many use cases, what is required is not just one prompt but a sequence of prompts where we need to also consider the outputs at each stage, before providing a final output - for example with a customer service chatbot.\n",

    "## Implementing a complex task with multiple prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "So why break up a task into several prompts when you can do it with just one question and chain of reasoning, as we discovered in my [previous article](https://livingdatalab.com/posts/2023-06-21-chain-of-thought-reasoning-with-chatgpt.html) ? \n",
    "We've already demonstrated that language models, especially more sophisticated models like GPT-4, are excellent at following complicated instructions. \n",
    "Let's compare chain of reasoning and chaining several prompts using two analogies to show why we would do this. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first analogy to contrast the two is the distinction between preparing a complicated dish all at once versus in phases. \n",
    "Trying to create a sophisticated meal all at once while managing different materials, cooking methods, and timings can be like using one long, convoluted instruction. \n",
    "Keeping track of everything and ensuring that each ingredient is cooked to perfection might be difficult. Chaining prompts, on the other hand, is similar to preparing a meal in stages, where you concentrate on one component at a time and make sure that each is cooked properly before moving on to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this method, the task's complexity is broken down, making it simpler to manage and lowering the possibility of mistakes. \n",
    "However, for a relatively straightforward recipe, this strategy can be overkill and unnecessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "A slightly better \n",
    "analogy for the same thing is the difference between \n",
    "reading spaghetti code with everything in one long file \n",
    "and a simple modular program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ambiguity and intricate relationships between distinct portions of the logic can make spaghetti code problematic and challenging to debug. A challenging one-step assignment given to a language model can have the same effect. \n",
    "When you have a workflow that allows you to preserve the state of the system at each given time and execute different actions based on the existing state, chaining prompts is a potent tactic. \n",
    "Following the categorization of an incoming customer query to indicate whether it is an account question or a product question, the current state would then be the classification, for example. And then based on the state you might do something different.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is easy to maintain, the model is given all the information it needs to complete a task, and the likelihood of errors is decreased because each subtask only contains the instructions necessary for one state of the task. \n",
    "Since longer prompts with more tokens cost more to operate and in some situations it may not be required to outline every step, this strategy can also result in cheaper costs. This method also makes it simpler to test which processes might be failing more frequently or to involve a person at a particular phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up - because this was a lengthy explanation, it may be preferable to keep track of the state externally and then add extra instructions as needed rather than describing an entire complex workflow in dozens of bullet points or several paragraphs in one prompt as in the [previous article](https://livingdatalab.com/posts/2023-06-21-chain-of-thought-reasoning-with-chatgpt.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "How complex is a problem, and why? In general, a problem is considered complicated if there are numerous different instructions, all of which may be applicable in any given circumstance. In these situations, it may be challenging for the model to reason about what to do. Additionally, as you work with and utilise these models more, you'll develop an understanding for when to apply this method instead of the prior one. \n",
    "\n",
    "It also enables the model to use other tools as necessary at specific stages of the workflow, which is another advantage I haven't yet mentioned. For instance, it might decide to do something that couldn't be done with a single prompt, like search a knowledge base, access an API, or seek something up in a product catalogue. \n",
    "Let's now move on to an illustration. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Extract relevant product and category names\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the same example as in my previous article, where we want to respond to a customer's query regarding a particular product, but this time we'll utilise more goods and also divide the steps down into a number of separate prompts. \n",
    "So we'll continue to use the delimiter from the earlier articles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's read through our system message. \n",
    "\n",
    ">\"You will be provided with customer service queries. \n",
    "The customer service query will be delimited with four \n",
    "hashtag characters.\" \n",
    "\n",
    ">\"Output a Python list of objects where each \n",
    "object has the following format.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Category, which is one \n",
    "of these predefined fields, or products. And this is a \n",
    "list of products that must be found in \n",
    "the allowed products below. \n",
    "\n",
    ">\"Where the categories and products must be found \n",
    "in the customer service query. \n",
    "If a product is mentioned, it must be associated with the \n",
    "correct category in the allowed products list below. \n",
    "If no products or categories are found, output an empty list.\". \n",
    "\n",
    "So now we have our allowed list of products and we have the categories and then the \n",
    "products within those categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "And our final instruction is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Only output the list \n",
    "of objects with nothing else.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "So next we have our user message. And so this message is:\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"tell me about the smarts pro phone and the fotosnap camera, \n",
    "the DSLR one.\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Also:\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"tell me about your TVs.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have questions concerning two specific items as well as this broad category of televisions. Additionally, the list of permitted products includes both of these items. We also have a section for television. \n",
    "After that, we format the user and system messages before adding them to the messages array. \n",
    "The model then provides the completion for us. \n",
    "As you can see, we have a list of objects for our output, with categories and goods for each object.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have the \"SmartX ProPhone\" \n",
    "and the \"Fotosnap DSLR Camera\". And then in the final object, \n",
    "we actually only have a category because we didn't \n",
    "mention any specific TVs. And so the benefit of \n",
    "outputting this structured response is that we can \n",
    "then read it into a list in Python, which is very nice. "

    "## Why use a subset rather than all product data?\n",
    "\n",
    "To clarify, we're asking is why we didn't simply put all of this product information in the prompt, saving us the trouble of having to go through all of the extra steps to actually seek up the product information. \n",
    "There are a few reasons for this. \n",
    "\n",
    "First off, having all the product descriptions could make the context more perplexing for the model, just as it would be for a person attempting to comprehend a lot of information at once. \n",
    "In particular, when the context is well structured, as it is in this example, and the model is intelligent enough to simply ignore the information that is obviously irrelevant, I will say that this is far less relevant for more sophisticated models like GPT-4.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following points are even more important. A fixed number of tokens are permitted as input and output in language models, which is the second reason. \n",
    "Therefore, you wouldn't even be able to fit all of the descriptions into the context window if you had a lot of things, like a massive product catalogue. \n",
    "The cost of integrating all of the product descriptions could be prohibitive because, when utilising language models, you pay per token. \n",
    "So you can lower the cost of producing responses by loading information carefully. \n",
    "\n",
    "**In general, one of the best ways to improve the capabilities of these models is to decide when to dynamically load information into the model's environment and let the model decide when it needs more information.**\n",
    "\n",
    "And once more, consider a language model to be a reasoning agent that needs the right environment in order to make intelligible decisions and carry out productive tasks. \n",
    "We had to provide the model with the relevant product information in this example in order for it to be able to use that information to reason and produce a good response for the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we just included a call to a certain function or functions in this example to obtain the product description by product name or the category items by category name. \n",
    "However, the models are truly adept at knowing when to utilise a range of different tools and are capable of using them correctly when given instructions. \n",
    "The concept behind ChatGPT plugins is the same. \n",
    "When the model needs information from a certain source or desires to take another relevant action, we notify it of the tools it has access to and what they perform. The model then decides to employ those tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are more sophisticated methods for information retrieval, in our example we can only seek up information by specific product and category name matches. \n",
    "**Using text embeddings is one of the best ways to obtain information** as I have done previosuly with my [articles using LangChain](https://livingdatalab.com/#category=langchain). \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, embeddings can be used to efficiently conduct knowledge retrieval over a big corpus to locate data relevant to a particular query. \n",
    "The ability to do fuzzy or semantic searches utilising text embeddings, which allow you to locate pertinent material without needing exact keywords, is one of their main benefits. Therefore, in our hypothetical situation, we wouldn't necessarily need to know the specific name of the device; instead, we could conduct a search using a more broad term, such as \"mobile phone.\" \n",
