    " \n",
    "Only the key information from each document will be extracted, and that information will be sent as the final return result. \n",
    "Since documents are frequently lengthy and confusing, we'll build a little function to beautifully print them out so that it's easier to understand what's going on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Information most relevant to a query may be buried in a document with a lot of irrelevant text. Passing that full document through your application can lead to more expensive LLM calls and poorer responses. Contextual compression is meant to fix this. \n",
    "\n",
    "With compression, you can then run \n",
    "all those documents through a language model and extract the most relevant \n",
    "segments and then pass only the most relevant segments \n",
    "into a final language model call. This \n",
    "comes at the cost of making more calls \n",
    "to the language model, but it's also really good for focusing the final \n",
    "answer on only the most important things. And so it's a bit \n",
    "of a tradeoff. Let's see these different techniques in action. We're going to \n",
