    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)** is a method from Linear Algebra that is used in a wide range of applications in science and engineering, similar to [Singular Value Decomopistion (SVD) which I covered in an earlier article](https://livingdatalab.com/mathematics/linear-algebra/natural-language-processing/2021/12/27/topic-modelling-svd.html). It can be used for tasks such as missing data imputation, audio signal processing and bioinformatics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Topic modeling** is an unsupervised machine learning technique used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that’s capable of scanning a set of texts, detecting word and phrase patterns within them, and automatically clustering word groups and similar expressions that best characterize a set of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article we will will use NMF to perform topic modelling.\n",

    "## Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)\n",
    "\n",
    "NMF is a method of matrix decomposition, so for a given matrix A we can convert it into 2 other matrices: W and H. Also A most have non-negative values, and as such W and H will also have non-negative values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://github.com/pranath/blog/raw/master/images/nmf.png \"Non-negative Matrix Factorization\")\n",
    "\n",
    "K is a value we choose in advance, in the case of our intention here K will repesent the number of topics we want to create for our topic model of the newsgroup posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we assume in the original matrix A for our exercise, N are the documents/posts and M are the words in our Document-Term matrix, each of these matricies represents the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- W: **Feature Matrix** this has M rows for words and K columns for the topics, and indicates which words characterise which topics.\n",
    "- H: **Coefficient Matrix** this has K rows for topics, and N columns for documents/posts, and indicates which topics best describe which documents/posts.\n",
    "\n",
    "So one reason NMF can be more popular to use, is due to that fact that the factors it produces are always positive and so are more easily interpretable. Consider for example with [SVD](https://livingdatalab.com/mathematics/linear-algebra/natural-language-processing/2021/12/27/topic-modelling-svd.html) we could produce factors that indicated negative values for topics - what would that mean to say a text has 'negative indications for the topic of bikes' ? \n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference with SVD is that NMF is not an exact decompostion - which means if we multiply W and H matrices we won't get back our original matrix A exactly.\n",

    "## NMF using Gradient Descent\n",
    "\n",
    "So in the method just used, we performed NMF using a built in library function from Sklearn. One of the obvious benefits of using this is that it runs extremely fast. However, in order to create this function it took many years of research and expertise in this area. Using this function also means we are limited, if we want to do something slightly different, we can't really change it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can use a very different method to calculate the NMF matrices using **Gradient Descent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic process of Gradient Descent is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Randomly choose some weights to start\n",
    "2. Loop:\n",
    "  - Use weights to calculate a prediction \n",
    "  - Calculate the loss (loss is a measure of the difference between the prediction and what we want)\n",
    "  - Calculate the derivative of the loss\n",
    "  - Update the weights using this derivative to tell us how much to change them\n",
    "3. Repeat step 2 lots of times. Eventually we end up with some decent weights\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the weights would be the values of the matrices we want to calculate for NMF which are the values of W and H.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Stocastic Gradient Decent (SGD)** we evaluate our loss function on just a sample of our data (sometimes called a mini-batch). We would get different loss values on different samples of the data, so this is why it is stochastic. It turns out that this is still an effective way to optimize, and it's much more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "[SGD is also a key technique used in Deep Learning which I have covered in an earlier article](https://livingdatalab.com/deep-learning-theory/2021/06/13/optimisation-methods-for-deep-learning.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applying SGD to NMF\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Frobenius norm](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/FrobeniusNorm.html) is a way to measure how different two matrices are. We can use this to calculate the loss by multipling W and H together to create a matrix, and then calculating the Frobenius norm between this matrix and our original matrix A to give us our loss value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Decompose $A\\;(m \\times n)$ into $$A \\approx WH$$ where $W\\;(m \\times k)$ and $H\\;(k \\times n)$, $W,\\;H\\;>=\\;0$, and we've minimized the Frobenius norm of $A-WH$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**: We will pick random positive $W$ & $H$, and then use SGD to optimize.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also make use of the [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) library for these calculations for 2 key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It facilitates calculations on the GPU which enables matrix calculations to be run in parallel and therefore much faster\n",
    "- Pytorch has the *autograd* functionality which will automatically calculate the derivatives of functions for us and thereby give us the gradients that we need for the process in a convenient way"
