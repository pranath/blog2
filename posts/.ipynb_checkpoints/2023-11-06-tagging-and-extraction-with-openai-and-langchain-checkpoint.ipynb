    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Structured data extraction is increasingly becoming an essential tool for developers who wish to harness the power of Large Language Model capabilities. This blog post aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how developers can use OpenAI functions for tagging and extraction, two primary use cases central to transforming unstructured text into structured, actionable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Tagging\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Concept of Tagging\n",
    "Tagging involves submitting unstructured text to an OpenAI language model along with structured instructions. The language model then generates a structured output, creating a response that aligns with the provided description. This output typically contains tags corresponding to the sentiment and language of the input text.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/pranath/blog/raw/master/images/tag-extract-1.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this example, we know that we want to generate an object that has the text's emotion as well as a tag for the language that we pass in. So, when we bring in an implicit text, we'll pass in a structured description that says \"extract some sentiment, extract some language,\" and the LLM will reason over that text and return an object with sentiment and language tags. This is comparable to, but slightly distinct from, the second use case, extraction. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Example of Tagging\n",
    "For instance, if we want to determine the sentiment of a text and its language, we structure a request that specifies these requirements. The model processes the text and returns an object tagged with both sentiment and language. This allows for a nuanced understanding of the content, which is crucial for various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Process of Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distinguishing Extraction from Tagging\n",
    "Extraction differs from tagging as it involves identifying and retrieving specific entities from text. Unlike tagging, where a single structured output is generated, extraction yields a list of elements, such as the names of mentioned academic papers in an article.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/pranath/blog/raw/master/images/tag-extract-2.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementing Extraction in Code\n",
    "We begin by importing necessary functions and classes, creating models that define the structured output we aim to extract. With these models, the OpenAI function can parse the text and return the requested entities in a structured format."

    "\n",
    "### Creating a Tagging Model\n",
    "Let's develop a tagging model using PyDantic. We define a schema instructing the model to tag sentiments and languages, outlining possible values for each tag. This schema guides the language model to understand and shape the data we're extracting.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we'll call the class tagging. We'll have a description that says tag the piece of text, which is your information, and then a list of the text that we have to utilise that we want to tag the text to. So, first, sentiment, and then a description of the sentiment. It has to be called pos, neg, or neutral. So we're defining values for the sentiment field, and remember, we're fitting past in the language model. So this is how we inform the language model what shape the data we're retrieving should have. We then have a language tag in here to get into the language. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we'll start with a description of the sentiment field. Because we know we'll always do tagging, we're attempting to force it to always do this tagging function. We can then establish a tagging chain by combining the prompt with this model and calling it... "

As a result, we are free to extract. This prompt is followed by the extraction model. And if we call this extraction chain the same thing, we can see that in the argument we have, name, Martha, and there's nothing else to do about age, it's correctly thinking that it doesn't need to provide information on our age. Again, we're probably capable of doing better than this AI message. "

    "### Streamlining the Extraction Process\n",
    "By employing a JSON key output function parser, we can extract specific data points without extraneous information. This refined output is not only cleaner but also more functional for subsequent data handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "And so, in this case, all we actually want is the value of the arguments, which is a JSON block, and it's quite convenient to have those parses with JSON because it's JSON in this JSON block. We want to be able to use the various elements individually. As a result, LangChain includes a handy small output parser that can assist with this. It's named JSONOutputFunctionsParser, and we'll import it from the OpenAI functions of LangChainOutputParser. Then we create our tagging chain, which we can do as a prompt, and we can connect it with the function model, and we'll now add this output parser into the final element. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can try to structure it by parsing it. So let's bring back the JSON assistance parser from previously. We can see that it's processed into this dictionary containing persons and then a list of names, as we call it again. However, there is some unnecessary information here that we don't actually need for extraction. We don't really care about this list of people since, as we defined it, information is merely a vehicle that allows us to extract many components from this person. What we truly care about is this list of individuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "For that, we can utilise a different assistance parser. We can use the function parser to import JSON keys. And what this will essentially do is look for a specific key, and the output will just contain that key. So we've slightly altered our extraction chain. We pass in our new helper parser, along with a key name and individuals to specify the field we wish to extract. Now, if we call it that, I'll rename it. As you can see, we now only have the list. So, while it's a tiny enhancement, it will make it easier to use downstream if extraction is indeed what we're after for this purpose. "

So keep in mind that the chain fits in an input variable, namely a dictionary with an input key. If we look at the first split in this list, it's just text. So we'll need a method to turn this collection of text into a list of dictionaries where that text is now the input key. We'll accomplish this by declaring a function for it, because this will be the initial function in the chain. \n",

So, once again, this extraction chain will return to the list as we specify it, resulting in a list of lists. As a result, we're going to call it flatten.

    "So it isn't completely parallelizing, but it is speeding up the sequence in and out. When all of those calls have been completed, it will be handed to the final flatten function. And there we have it. It returns a list of extracted papers, so step the title and step the author. It had been skimmed through. For some of them, we can see that it leaves the author empty. \n",

    "If you look at these references you will see we have document A and author A. This looks to be incorrect, but if you look at the article that this is referencing, you will see that it gives itself article as examples in code in that artical, in which it includes, among other things, extraction and retrieval of the generation. So there's a lot of language in there that's emulating some false papers and getting a response like this. As a result, they're picking it up appropriately. \n",

    "\n",
    "Tagging and extraction are powerful methods for turning unstructured text into structured data, opening up numerous possibilities for data analysis and insight generation. By understanding and applying these techniques through OpenAI's functions and Langchain, developers can efficiently address common use cases and unlock the full potential of language models for data structuring tasks.\n",
