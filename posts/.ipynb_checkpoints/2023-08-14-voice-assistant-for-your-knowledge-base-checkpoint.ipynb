    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we plan to build a voice assistant for a knowledge base. This post will explain how to create your own voice assistant using cutting-edge artificial intelligence tools. OpenAI's Whisper, a sophisticated automatic speech recognition (ASR) algorithm, is used by the voice assistant. Whisper efficiently converts our vocal inputs to text. After we've transcribed our speech inputs into text, we'll focus on creating voice outputs. We use Eleven Labs to accomplish this, which allows the voice assistant to reply to users in an engaging and natural manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project's heart is centred on a reliable question-answering mechanism. This procedure begins by loading the vector database, a repository containing several documents relevant to our possible searches. When a question is posed, the system pulls the papers from this database and feeds them to the LLM along with the question. The LLM then generates the response depending on the documents that have been retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to build a voice assistant that can rapidly navigate a knowledge base and provide precise and timely solutions to a user's inquiries. We're going to use GitHub's ['JarvisBase'](https://github.com/peterw/JarvisBase) repository for this experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Import Libs & Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We'd begin by installing the prerequisites. These are the libraries that will be required. While we strongly advise installing the most recent versions of these packages, please keep in mind that the codes have only been tested using the versions shown in brackets.\n",

    "This section of code searches the vector database for the most appropriate answers to the user's inquiry. It initially turns the database into a retriever, which is a tool that searches the vector space for the closest embeddings. It then configures various search parameters, such as the metric to use when measuring distance in the embedding space, the number of documents to fetch initially, whether to use maximal marginal relevance to balance the diversity and relevance of the results, and how many results to return. The obtained results are then processed by the language model, which in this case is GPT-3.5 Turbo, to provide the most relevant response to the user's inquiry.\n",
