    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We will examine the integration of various LLM models in LangChain in this article. We will look at and contrast the aspects of the platforms that enable these LLM types. Some of the most well-liked pre-trained models that are publicly accessible are already supported by LangChain. We have previously covered a number of alternatives in earlier posts, including ChatGPT, GPT-4, GPT-3, and GPT4ALL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nearly 30 connectors with well-known AI platforms are offered by this framework, including OpenAI, Cohere, Writer, and Replicate, to mention a few. Most significantly, they give you access to the Huggingface Hub API, which has more than 120K models available and is simple to integrate into your applications. There are numerous ways to use the services provided by these organisations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The payment for the API interfaces is customary. The pricing are typically based on variables like the quantity of tokens handled, as seen in OpenAI, or the amount of GPU time required for the process, as seen in Huggingface Interface or Amazon Sagemaker. The majority of these choices are quick and simple to set up. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that even though the models were developed using your valuable datasets, you do not own them. Simple pay-as-you-go access to the API is all they offer unless they are explicitly open source e.g. hugging face.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, it is feasible to host the models locally on your servers. You will be able to control the network and your dataset completely and only thanks to it. It is crucial to be conscious of the expenditures connected with this strategy's hardware (a high-end GPU for low latency) and maintenance (the skills to deploy and fine-tune models). Several publicly accessible models, such LLaMA-1, are also inaccessible for commercial use - though of course the recently released LLaMA-2 is available for commerical use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on factors including money, model capabilities, knowledge, and trade secrets, the best strategy differs for each use case. By providing your data to OpenAI's API, it is simple to develop a unique fine-tuned model. If the dataset is a part of your intellectual property and cannot be shared, on the other hand, you can think about performing fine-tuning internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another thing to think about is the features of the various models. Its capacity to grasp languages is directly influenced by the network sizes and dataset quality. In contrast, the best solution isn't usually a bigger model. The Ada variant of the GPT-3 has the lowest latency and is the fastest and most economical device in the collection. It is suitable for simpler jobs though, such text processing or classification. On the other hand, the most recent GPT-4 version is the biggest model to produce excellent outcomes for each task.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because of the numerous parameters, it is the most time-consuming and expensive alternative. As a result, choosing the model based on their aptitude is equally essential. Ada may be more cost-effective for developing a conversational application, but this is not the model's goal and will yield unsatisfactory results. (This article compares several well-known LLMs; you can read it.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The remainder of this article will introduce a number of LangChain integrations to aid in making the best decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Popular LLM models accessible to LangChain via API\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cohere Command \n",
    "\n",
    "A variety of models are available through the Cohere service, including Command (command) for dialogue-like interactions, Generation (basic) for generative activities, Summarise (summarize-xlarge) for producing summaries, and more. Free, time-limited use is available for learning and prototyping. This indicates that use is cost-free up until you enter production; nevertheless, some models might cost a little more than OpenAI APIs once you do, such as $2.5 for creating 1K tokens. However, because Cohere provides increasingly tailored models for every job, this can result in a more use case-specific model having better results in subsequent tasks. It is simple to retrieve these models thanks to the LangChain's Cohere class. Model=\"MODEL_NAME>\", cohere_api_key=\"API_KEY>\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### GPT-3.5\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI created the language model GPT-3.5. Its turbo version, which OpenAI advises over earlier iterations, provides a less expensive way to produce human-like writing via an API reachable via OpenAI endpoints. The model can process 96 languages and is tailored for chat applications while still being effective for other generating tasks. The most affordable option from the OpenAI collection, GPT-3.5-turbo costs only $0.002 per 1000 tokens and has a context length of up to 16K tokens. Use the gpt-3.5-turbo key when initialising the ChatOpenAI or OpenAI classes to gain access to this model's API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GPT-4\n",
    "\n",
    "The GPT-4 model from OpenAI is a capable multimodal model with an unspecified amount of parameters or training steps. It is the newest and most powerful model that OpenAI has ever released, and thanks to its multi-modality, it can handle input from both text and images. Unfortunately, access to it requires filing an early access request via the OpenAI platform as it is not generally accessible. The model comes in two separate iterations called gpt-4 and gpt-4-32k, with context lengths of 8192 and 32768 tokens, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jurassic-2\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jurassic-2 language model from AI21 comes in three sizes and several price ranges: Jumbo, Grande, and Large. Although the model sizes are private, the Jumbo version is listed in their paperwork as the most potent model. They characterise the models as being excellent at every generating task and general-purpose. Seven languages are supported by their J2 model, which may be customised using unique datasets. You can access these models by using the AI21()class and obtaining your API key from the AI21 platform.\n",
