    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. But using LLMs in isolation is often not enough in practice to create a truly powerful or useful business application - the real power comes when you are able to combine them with other sources of computation, services or knowledge. [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html) is an intuitive open-source python framework created to simplify the development of useful applications using large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI or Hugging Face. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we will give an overview of the LangChain framework and then look in more detail at 3 key components: Models, Prompts and Parsers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LangChain Overview & Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "The LangChain development team believes that the strongest and most distinctive LLM applications won't just reference a language model, they'll also be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data-aware:** connect a language model to other sources of data\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agentic:** allow a language model to interact with its environment\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts serve as the foundation for the LangChain framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental abstractions that serve as the foundation for any LLM-powered programme are known as LangChain modules.\n",
    "LangChain offers standardised, expandable interfaces for each module. Additionally, LangChain offers third-party integrations and complete implementations for commercial use.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modules are (from least to most complex):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Models:** Supported model types and integrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prompts:** Prompt management, optimization, and serialization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Memory:** Memory refers to state that is persisted between calls of a chain/agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indexes:** Language models become much more powerful when combined with application-specific data - this module contains interfaces and integrations for loading, querying and updating external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chains:** Chains are structured sequences of calls (to an LLM or to a different utility).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agents:** An agent is a Chain in which an LLM, given a high-level directive and a set of tools, repeatedly decides an action, executes the action and observes the outcome until the high-level directive is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Callbacks:** Callbacks let you log and stream the intermediate steps of any chain, making it easy to observe, debug, and evaluate the internals of an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/pranath/blog/raw/master/images/langchain-overview.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides ready to go built in implementations of common useful LLM usecases for the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Autonomous Agents:** Autonomous agents are long-running agents that take many steps in an attempt to accomplish an objective. Examples include AutoGPT and BabyAGI.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent Simulations:** Putting agents in a sandbox and observing how they interact with each other and react to events can be an effective way to evaluate their long-range reasoning and planning abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Personal Assistants:** One of the primary LangChain use cases. Personal assistants need to take actions, remember interactions, and have knowledge about your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Question Answering:** Another common LangChain use case. Answering questions over specific documents, only utilizing the information in those documents to construct an answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chatbots:** Language models love to chat, making this a very natural use of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Querying Tabular Data:** Recommended reading if you want to use language models to query structured data (CSVs, SQL, dataframes, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Understanding:** Recommended reading if you want to use language models to analyze code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interacting with APIs:** Enabling language models to interact with APIs is extremely powerful. It gives them access to up-to-date information and allows them to take actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extraction:** Extract structured information from text.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Summarization:** Compressing longer documents. A type of Data-Augmented Generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evaluation:** Generative models are hard to evaluate with traditional metrics. One promising approach is to use language models themselves to do the evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## OpenAI Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "For our examples we will be using OpenAi ChatGPT models, so lets load the required libs and config.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to load certain python libs and connect the OpenAi api.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenAi api library needs to be configured with an account's secret key, which is available on the [website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). \n",
    "\n",
    "You can either set it as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before using the library:\n",
    " ```\n",
    " !export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, set `openai.api_key` to its value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import openai\n",
    "openai.api_key = \"sk-...\"\n",
    "```"

    "As you build more sophisticated applications using prompts and LLM's, prompts can become longer and more detailed. Prompt Templates can help with efficiency to be able to re-use good prompts. LangChain conveniently provides pre-defined prompts for common operations to speed up development such as text summarisation, question-answering, and connecting to databases etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output Parsers\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain also supports output parsing. When you build a complex application using an LLM, you often instruct the LLM to generate the output in a certain format - for example using specific keywords to separate different parts of the response. One format for example is called ['Chain of Thought Reasoning' (ReAct)](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/11/react-synergizing-reasoning-and-acting.html) which uses keywords such as **Thought, Action & Observation** encourages the model to take more time thinking through a problem/request/prompt which tends to lead to better outputs and solutions as we learned in a [previous article](https://livingdatalab.com/posts/2023-05-01-best-practice-for-prompting-large-language-models.html#principle-2-give-the-model-time-to-think). Using LangChain can help us ensure we are using some of the best and most upto date methods for LLM prompting - much like the [PyCaret](https://livingdatalab.com/posts/2021-12-04-python-power-tools-pycaret.html) library does for conventional machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example and start with defining how we would like the LLM output to look like. Let's say we have a JSON output from the LLM and we would like to be able to parse that output. \n",
