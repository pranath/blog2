    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. But using LLMs in isolation is often not enough in practice to create a truly powerful or useful business application - the real power comes when you are able to combine them with other sources of computation, services or knowledge. [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html) is an intuitive open-source python framework created to simplify the development of useful applications using large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI or Hugging Face. \n",
    "\n",
    "In [other articles](/#category=langchain) we introduced the LangChain library and key components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we will look at how LangChain can give LLM's context and memory which can be useful for applications such as Chatbots where remembering previous parts of a conversation can be very helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use OpenAI's ChatGPT LLM for our examples, so lets load in the required libraries."

When Chatbots appear to have 'memory' this is due to the whole previous conversation being explicitly provided as context for each transaction. \n",

LangChain also supports other types of memory such as:\n",

    "- **Entity memories:** Using an LLM, remembering details about specific entities e.g. specific people, organisations etc\n",
