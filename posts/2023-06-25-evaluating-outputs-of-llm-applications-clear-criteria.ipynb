    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models such as [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) can generate text responses based on a given prompt or input. Writing prompts allow users to guide the language model's output by providing a specific context or topic for the response. This feature has many practical applications, such as generating creative writing prompts, assisting in content creation, and even aiding in customer service chatbots. \n",
    "\n",
    "In [earlier articles](/#category=openai) i've looked at how you can use ChatGPT to solve some of these tasks with simple prompts. But in many use cases, what is required is not just one prompt but a sequence of prompts where we need to also consider the outputs at each stage, before providing a final output - for example with a customer service chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have also seen previously how to build an application using an LLM from evaluating the inputs to processing the inputs to then doing final output checking before you show the output to the user. After you've built such a system, how do you know how it's working? And maybe even as you deploy it and let users use it, how can you track how it's doing and find any shortcomings and continue to improve the quality of the answers of your system? \n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we will look at some best practices for evaluating the outputs of an LLM when we have a clearer sense of the outputs we want, and show what it feels like to build one of these systems. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Or, set `openai.api_key` to its value:\n",

    "## Best Practices for Evaluating Large Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences between tradtional machine learning and LLM models\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant difference between evaluating LLMs and evaluating more conventional machine learning supervised learning applications is that because such applications can be built so quickly, the methodologies for evaluating them frequently do not begin with a test set. Instead, you frequently find yourself progressively assembling a collection of test instances. \n",
    "Let's examine what this implies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from [earlier articles](https://livingdatalab.com/#category=openai) how prompt-based development reduces the duration of the key phases of model creation from possibly months to only a few minutes, hours, or at most a few days. \n",
    "In the conventional supervised learning approach, the incremental cost of collecting an additional 1,000 test examples isn't that high if you already required to gather, let's say, 10,000 labelled examples. Therefore, it was common practise in the classic supervised learning context to gather a training set, gather a development set, or gather a holdout cross-validation set in the test set, and then tap those available during this development phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you can specify a prompt in a matter of minutes and get something up and running in a matter of hours, it would seem like a major inconvenience to have to stop for a considerable amount of time to gather 1,000 test samples because you cannot get something to function with no training examples. \n",
    "So, this is how it typically feels while developing an application utilising an LLM. You would first fine-tune the prompts using just a few examples—perhaps one to three or five—and try to find a prompt that applies to them. \n",
    "Then you encounter a few challenging examples as you put the system through extra testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "They are incompatible with either the algorithm or the prompt. \n",
    "And in that scenario, you can just add more challenging cases by taking these extra one, two, three, or five examples and adding them to the collection that you're testing on. \n",
    "Once you've added enough of these examples to your gradually expanding development collection, it gets a little annoying to have to manually run each example through the prompt each time the prompt is changed. \n",
    " \n",
    "Then you start creating measures to gauge success on this condensed collection of samples, such perhaps average accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterative LLM testing\n",
    "\n",
    "And an intriguing feature of this method is that you can stop at any point and skip to the next bullet if you determine your system is operating well enough. \n",
    "In fact, a lot of deployed programmes stop working at the first or second bullet and continue to function well. \n",
    "The next stage is to get a randomly sampled collection of instances to tweak the model to if your hand-built development set, which you are using to evaluate it, isn't giving you enough confidence in the performance of your system yet. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that it would be normal practise to keep tailoring your prompt to this, this would continue to be a development set or hold-out cross-validation set. \n",
    "And only if you require an even higher level of realism in your estimate of the system's performance should you gather and employ hold-out test sets that you don't even look at when fine-tuning the model. Therefore, step four is usually more crucial if, for example, your system is only providing the correct answer 91% of the time and you want to tune it so that it provides the correct answer 92% or 93% of the time. In this case, you will need a larger sample size to assess the differences between 91% and 93% performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "The only time you would need to collect a hold-out test set in addition to the development set would be if you truly needed an objective, fair assessment of how the system was performing. One crucial qualification: consider big language models where the risk of harm if it provides an incorrect answer isn't meaningful. \n",
    " \n",
    "However, it goes without saying that for any high-stakes applications, if there is a possibility of bias or an inappropriate output harming someone, the responsibility to gather a test set and rigorously evaluate your system's performance to ensure it is acting correctly before you use it becomes much more important. \n",
    " \n",
    "However, if you are using it, for instance, to summarise articles solely for your own reading and no one else's, then perhaps the risk of harm is less significant, and you can stop this process early without incurring the costs of bullets four and five and gathering larger data sets on which to evaluate your algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Get the relevant products and categories\n",
    "\n",
    "So for our example, we will start with the usual helper functions. We will use the utils function to get a list of products and categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The utils python module and json used for this example can be found in this [github location](https://github.com/pranath/pds/tree/main/articles/2023-06-24).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the list of products and categories that are in the product catalog.\n",
