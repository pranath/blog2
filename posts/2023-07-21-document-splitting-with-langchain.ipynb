    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article we look at how you can split documents as an important step in making content available for Large Language Models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Document Splitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting documents may sound easy, but there are many small details make a great difference in the long run in this situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/pranath/blog/raw/master/images/lc-data1.jpg\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your data is loaded into the document format, document splitting takes place. However, before that happens, and despite how straightforward it may seem, it enters the vector store. \n",
    "Alternatively, you might divide the chunks into equal portions based on the lengths of the individual characters. \n",
    "However, let's look at this scenario here as an illustration of why this is both more difficult and crucial in the long run. The Toyota Camry is mentioned in a sentence along with certain details. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/pranath/blog/raw/master/images/lc-data2.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we simply split the sentence into two halves, we can wind up with one part of the sentence in one chunk and the other part in another. Later on, when we try to respond to an inquiry about the Camry's specifications, we discover that neither chunk contains the necessary details, thus it is divided. Therefore, we would be unable to provide a suitable response to your query. So, how you divide the chunks so that you get semantically important chunks together requires a lot of intricacy and care.\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of each and every text splitter in LangChain is the splitting of text into pieces of a certain size and overlap. We've included a small diagram below to illustrate how that would appear. There are various techniques to determine the chunk size. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/pranath/blog/raw/master/images/lc-data3.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the chunk's size, we therefore enable passing in a length function. It frequently consists of symbols or tokens. When moving from one chunk to the next, we typically keep a small overlap between the two chunks, much like a sliding window. Furthermore, it helps establish some semblance of consistency because it permits the identical contextual information to appear at both the beginning and the conclusion of two separate chunks. Each of Lang Chain's text splitters has a way for creating documents and splitting them. Under the hood, the logic is the same; the interface, which can accept lists of text or lists of documents, is just a little bit different. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/pranath/blog/raw/master/images/lc-data4.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "These text splitters come in a wide range of sizes. \n",
    "How the chunks are divided up and which characters go into each one can vary. \n",
    "The methods used to determine the size of the chunks can differ. \n",
    "Are the characters used? Do they use tokens? \n",
    "Some even divide sentences into chunks by using other, more precise models to identify when a sentence might be finished. \n",
    "The metadata is yet another crucial component of chunking. There are certain text splitters that are highly focused on keeping the same metadata across all chunks while also introducing new pieces of metadata when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "When splitting on code, it becomes very clear that the splitting of chunks can frequently depend on the sort of document we're working with. \n",
    "As a result, we have a language text splitter with a wide range of separators for languages like Python, Ruby, and C. Additionally, when separating these documents, it takes into account the various languages as well as the appropriate separators for each language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Load Libs and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment will first be set up as before by loading the Open AI API key. Next, we'll import two of Lang Chain's most popular categories of text splitters. the character text splitter as well as the recursive character text splitter. We'll first experiment with a few toy use cases to acquire a better understanding of what these actually do. So, just to illustrate what they can do, we're going to set a somewhat small chunk size of 26, and an even smaller chunk overlap of 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's initialise these two text splitters as R and C, respectively. Finally, let's examine a few alternative use-case scenarios. "
