    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. But using LLMs in isolation is often not enough in practice to create a truly powerful or useful business application - the real power comes when you are able to combine them with other sources of computation, services or knowledge. [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html) is an intuitive open-source python framework created to simplify the development of useful applications using large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI or Hugging Face. \n",
    "\n",
    "In [earlier articles](/#category=langchain) we introduced the LangChain library and key components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we will look at the Chains component of LangChain and see how this can help us combine different sequences of events using LLM's.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use OpenAI's ChatGPT LLM for our examples, so lets load in the required libraries."
