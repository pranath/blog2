    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are frequently used to hold enterprise data. Natural language interaction with SQL databases is made feasible by LLMs such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and GPT Models. LangChain provides SQL Chains and Agents for building and running SQL queries based on natural language prompts. These SQL Chains and Agents are compatible with any SQL dialect supported by SQLAlchemy (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle SQL, Databricks, SQLite).\n",
    "\n",
    "They enable use cases like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Creating queries that will be executed in response to natural language questions\n",
    "- Developing chatbots that can answer queries based on database data \n",
    "- Developing custom dashboards based on information that a user want to analyse\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article we will see different ways we can use langchain and LLM's to ask questions about data in an SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain provides tools to interact with SQL Databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Build SQL queries` based on natural language user questions\n",
    "2. `Query a SQL database` using chains for query creation and execution\n",
    "3. `Interact with a SQL database` using agents for robust and flexible querying\n",

    "LangChain has a SQL Agent that is more flexible than the 'SQLDatabaseChain' in communicating with SQL Databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the primary benefits of utilising the SQL Agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It can answer questions based on the schema as well as the content of the databases (for example, describing a specific table).\n",
    "- It can recover from problems by running a created query, capturing the traceback, and correctly rebuilding it.\n",

    "\n",
    "> *'...Let us first understand what is an agent and why it might be preferred over a simple SQLChain. An agent is a component that has access to a suite of tools, including a Large Language Model (LLM). Its distinguishing characteristic lies in its ability to make informed decisions based on user input, utilizing the appropriate tools until it achieves a satisfactory answer. For example in the context of text-to-SQL, the LangChain SQLAgent will not give up if there is an error in executing the generated SQL. Instead, it will attempt to recover by interpreting the error in a subsequent LLM call and rectify the issue. Therefore, in theory, SQLAgent should outperform SQLChain in productivity and accuracy'*\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is what that author found from their experiments:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *'...During our tests, we ran multiple questions on both SQLChain and SQLAgent using GPT-3.5 and compared their respective results. Our findings revealed that SQLAgent outperformed SQLChain by answering a greater number of questions...For accuracy, however, our findings also indicate a higher incidence of incorrect responses from SQLAgent. Besides the general shortcomings of using LLM to query database, we hypothesize that SQLAgent will occasionally make its best attempt to answer a question even when concrete results cannot be obtained from the SQL query.'*\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'create_sql_agent' method is used to initialise the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This agent includes the 'SQLDatabaseToolkit,' which includes tools for:\n",

    "* Create and run queries \n",
    "* Verify query syntax \n",
