    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "It's critical to stay current on news and information in the fast-paced world of today. However, reading through numerous news pieces might take time. Let's create a News Articles Summarizer application utilising ChatGPT and LangChain to help you save time and receive a brief overview of the key points. We can scrape articles from the internet, extract their titles and text, and produce succinct summaries using this robust programme. We will walk you through the process of creating a summarizer in this lecture. We will apply the ideas we covered in past sessions, showing how they would be used in a practical situation.\n",

    "<img src=\"https://github.com/pranath/blog/raw/master/images/news-article-summariser.png\" width=\"800\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do this in the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Installing necessary libraries: Before beginning, make sure you have requests, newspaper3k, and langchain installed.\n",
    "2. Scrape content: Utilise the requests library to scrape the targeted news articles' content from the corresponding URLs.\n",
    "3. Titles and text of excerpts: Use the newspaper library to parse the HTML that was scraped and extract the article titles and text.\n",
    "4. Pre-process the text: To prepare the retrieved texts for input into ChatGPT, clean and preprocess them.\n",
    "5. Produce summaries: Use ChatGPT to condense the text of the extracted articles.\n",
    "6. Publish the results: Present the summaries with the original article titles to help readers immediately understand each piece's important ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this process, we may develop a useful News Articles Summarizer that makes use of ChatGPT to deliver insightful information in a time-saving manner. Stay informed and benefit from AI-powered summaries without having to spend hours going through large articles.\n",

      "“We hope RSC will help us build entirely new AI systems that can, for example, power real-time voice translations to large groups of people, each speaking a different language, so they can seamlessly collaborate on a research project or play an AR game together,” wrote Meta in a blog post.\n",

      "“Ultimately, the work done with RSC will pave the way toward building technologies for the next major computing platform — the metaverse, where AI-driven applications and products will play an important role.”\n",

      "For production, Meta expects RSC will be 20x faster than Meta’s current V100-based clusters. RSC is also estimated to be 9x faster at running the NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) and 3x faster at training large-scale NLP workflows.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, we've shown how to use ChatGPT and LangChain's features to build a powerful News Articles Summarizer. By collecting and condensing important information from a variety of publications into understandable, AI-generated summaries, this powerful tool makes it easier to stay informed. By turning these summaries into bulleted lists, the process has been improved and made easier to read and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've also broadened the scope of our summarizer to deliver summaries in many languages, with French serving as our model in response to the demands of a multilingual audience. This demonstrates the capability of our product to serve a varied, international audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach we've detailed is the core of this post; it's a step-by-step tutorial that gives you the power to create your own summarizer. By doing this, you may speed up the process of consuming information, save a lot of time, and keep up with current events.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we have studied the subtleties of prompt creation. The model must comprehend the objective, which in our instance included summarising an article into a list of bullet points and doing so in a different language, so a well-written prompt is essential. You can further modify the model to provide outcomes that meet your specific needs by understanding the subtleties of prompt design.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Acknowledgements\n",
