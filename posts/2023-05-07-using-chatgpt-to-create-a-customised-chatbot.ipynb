    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models such as [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) can generate text responses based on a given prompt or input. Writing prompts allow users to guide the language model's output by providing a specific context or topic for the response. This feature has many practical applications, such as generating creative writing prompts, assisting in content creation, and even aiding in customer service chatbots. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a writing prompt such as \"Write a short story about a time traveler who goes back to the medieval period\" could lead the language model to generate a variety of unique and creative responses. Additionally, prompts can be used to generate more specific and relevant responses for tasks such as language translation or summarization. In these cases, the prompt would provide information about the desired output, such as the language to be translated or the key points to be included in the summary. Overall, prompts provide a way to harness the power of large language models for a wide range of practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, creating effective prompts for large language models remains a significant challenge, as even prompts that seem similar can produce vastly different outputs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my previous article, we looked at [how to use ChatGPT to generate customer service emails that are tailored to each customer's review](2023-05-06-expanding-and-customising-text-using-large-language-models.html).\n",

    "In this article, we will look at how to use ChatGPT to utilize its chat format to have extended conversations with chatbots personalized or specialized for specific tasks or behaviors.\n",

    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Load the API key and relevant Python libaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to load certain python libs and connect the OpenAi api.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenAi api library needs to be configured with an account's secret key, which is available on the [website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). \n",
    "\n",
    "You can either set it as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable before using the library:\n",
    " ```\n",
    " !export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-...'\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, set `openai.api_key` to its value:\n",

    "### Helper functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` model and the [chat completions endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat). \n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to define two helper functions. If you kind of look at get_completion(), though, you'll see that we give a prompt, but then kind of inside the function, what we're actually doing is inserting this prompt into what appears to be some sort of user message. And the reason for this is that the ChatGPT model is a chat model, trained to accept a stream of messages as input and output a message that was generated by the model. The assistant message is the output, and the user message serves as kind of the input. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, we're actually going to use the second helper function and pass in a list of messages rather than kind of giving it one prompt and obtaining one completion. I'll go over those because these messages might come in a variety of various forms from those jobs. So, for illustration's sake, below is a sample message list.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the initial message is a system message that serves as a general instruction. Following this message, the user and the assistant take turns speaking. And something like this would keep happening. Your messages are the user messages if you've ever used ChatGPT's web interface, and ChatGPT's messages are the assistant messages. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the system message serves as a form of high-level directive for the dialogue and helps to establish the assistant's behaviours and identity. So, without the user being aware of the system message, it can be compared to whispering in the assistant's ear and kind of directing its responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if you've ever used ChatGPT, it's likely that you have no idea what is contained in the system message. The system message has the advantage of giving you, the developer, a means to frame the dialogue without including the request itself in it. Therefore, you can sort of direct the assistant, whisper in its ear, and direct its responses without the user being aware of it. "

    "\n",
    "One of the fascinating aspects of a large language model is that it can be used to quickly and easily create a personalised chatbot. You can hold a conversation using a large language model through ChatGPT's online interface, which is designed to be conversational. But one of the great things is that you can create a custom chatbot that can serve as an AI order taker for a restaurant or a large language model to play the part of an AI customer support agent. \n",
