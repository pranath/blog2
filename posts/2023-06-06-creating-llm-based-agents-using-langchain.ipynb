    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not. But using LLMs in isolation is often not enough in practice to create a truly powerful or useful business application - the real power comes when you are able to combine them with other sources of computation, services or knowledge. [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html) is an intuitive open-source python framework created to simplify the development of useful applications using large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI or Hugging Face.\n",
    "\n",
    "In [earlier articles](/#category=langchain) we introduced the LangChain library and key components.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we will use LangChain to create LLM based agents. People often see LLM's as a knowledge store, but you could also see them as a reasoning engine, where you give it various sources of new information to help answer questions, reason through content or even to decide what to do next. This is what LangChains agent framework helps you to do, using different tools such as DuckDuckGo search and Wikipedia and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",

    "We will use OpenAI's ChatGPT LLM for our examples, so lets load in the required libraries."
