This is where I showcase some of the most recent skills I've learned in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, by building projects to demonstrate what is possible using some of the most recent advances and tools.

More details about how I built these projects can be found in [this article](/posts/2023-06-14-key-considerations-when-creating-practical-applications-with-llms.html).

If you have any feedback, comments or suggestions about any of these projects do [let me know](/about.html).
