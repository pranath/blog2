  <title>Chossing a Pre-Trained Large Language Model</title>
  <dc:creator>Pranath Fernando</dc:creator>
  <link>http://livingdatalab.com/posts/2023-07-06-choosing-pretrained-llm.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ The project life cycle for generative AI was introduced in this <a href="../posts/2023-07-04-generative-ai-project-lifecycle.html">previous article</a>. There are a few tasks to complete before you can launch your generative AI app, as we saw there. Selecting a model to work with comes after you have defined your use case and chosen how the LLM will operate within your application. Working with an existing model or creating your own from scratch will be your first option. In some situations, it may be advantageous to build your own model from scratch. In most cases, though, you’ll use an existing foundation model to start the process of constructing your application. ]]></description>

  <title>Summarising Dialogue using Generative AI</title>
  <dc:creator>Pranath Fernando</dc:creator>
  <link>http://livingdatalab.com/posts/2023-07-05-summarising-dialogue-using-generative-ai.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ In this article I will perform dialogue summarization using generative AI. We will explore how the input text affects the output of the model, and perform prompt engineering to direct it towards the task we need. By comparing zero shot, one shot, and few shot inferences, we will take the first steps towards prompt engineering and see how it can enhance the generative output of Large Language Models. ]]></description>

  <title>An Approach to the Generative AI Project Lifecyle</title>
  <dc:creator>Pranath Fernando</dc:creator>
  <link>http://livingdatalab.com/posts/2023-07-04-generative-ai-project-lifecycle.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ Recent advances in AI such as ChatGPT have demonstrated impressive abilities for performing a wide range of tasks previously only done by humans, these are known as Large Language Models (LLM’s). However, there are so many different options and methods for building applications with these models, and these are all new methods. It can seem overhelming and not obvious how to approach building Generative AI applications. In this article, I will present a high level project architecture for building Generative AI projects that could be applied to any project, which has been proposed by DeepLearning AI and AWS in their <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/generative-ai-with-llms/">Generative AI with Large Language Models Course</a> which I recently completed. ]]></description>

  <description><![CDATA[ Recent advances in AI such as ChatGPT have demonstrated impressive abilities for performing a wide range of tasks previously only done by humans, these are known as Large Language Models (LLM’s). Once you have chosen a model, you often have some configuration options that let you control the outputs. In this article we will take a high level non-technical view of what these generative configuration options allow you to do. ]]></description>

  <title>A High Level Overview of Prompting and In-Context Learning for Large Language Models</title>
  <dc:creator>Pranath Fernando</dc:creator>
  <link>http://livingdatalab.com/posts/2023-07-02-high-level-prompting-prompt-engineering.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ Recent advances in AI such as ChatGPT have demonstrated impressive abilities for performing a wide range of tasks previously only done by humans, these are known as Large Language Models (LLM’s). One key aspect for using these LLM’s is called prompting - which is how to write text requests to get the outputs you want from these models. In <a href="../#category=natural-language-processing">previous articles</a> I’ve looked at detailed practical use cases for how to make these prompts. In this article we will take a high level non-technical view of what prompting is all about, and introduce what in-context learning is. ]]></description>
