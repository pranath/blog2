  <description><![CDATA[ Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a transformative technology, enabling developers to build applications that they previously could not.

  <title>An Introduction to the Transformer Model - The power behind recent advances in AI</title>
  <dc:creator>Pranath Fernando</dc:creator>
  <link>http://livingdatalab.com/posts/2023-03-29-a-basic-overview-of-transfomer-models.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ AI and Deep Learning Models are behind recent applications such as Chat-GPT and GPT-4 which have amazed the world, and have created exciting possibilities for applications for business and society. But how do these models actually work? Most of the explanations online are deeply techincal which can make these models hard to understand for many people. Admitedly, most of my own previous articles on <a href="../#category=natural-language-processing">this topic</a> have also gone more into the technical details of how these models work, yet I also believe the essence of these models can be explained without any technical details or code. The main technology behind these recent advances is something called the <em>Transfomer Model</em> which was first created in 2017. ]]></description>

  <title>Using an efficient transformer to create an interactive and more complex chatbot</title>
  <dc:creator>Pranath Fernando</dc:creator>
  <link>http://livingdatalab.com/posts/2023-03-28-using-an-efficient-transformer-to-create-an-interactive-complex-chatbot.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ In this project, we are going to use the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451">Reformer</a>, also known as the efficient Transformer, to generate a dialogue between two bots. We will feed conversations to our model and it will learn how to understand the context of each one. Not only will it learn how to answer questions but it will also know how to ask questions if it needs more info. For example, after a customer asks for a train ticket, the chatbot can ask what time the said customer wants to leave. You could use this concept to automate call centers, hotel receptions, personal trainers, or any type of customer service. ]]></description>
